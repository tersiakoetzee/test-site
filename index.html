          <h2> Education </h2>
          <p>
            I did not get the conventional start to education so I started school at 12 due to not being in the
            school system, as a result I went to a technical school and learnt a trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that time I got invited to a free computer course in my community, after that there were a few
            Grassroots classes for introduction to code this is what sparked an interest in coding for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have since been in some short courses for coding and got the opportunity to do a learnership
            For digital analytics.
